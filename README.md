# Spotlight-Social-Network
SpotLight was supposed to be a social network, I started developing it when I was 16. I developed it about 3 Years, now I have stopped working and share the source code. I uploaded the server and app code. A camera with face recognition and filters is also installed in the app. You can send pictures and videos and then save them.
There is no Sql-Scheme file with in just code. I coded it so you can use some feature, for all Feature you need
to host the Server.


PS: if(iAmSearchingAJob) System.out.println("Send me a mail if you have Work for me esaph.re@gmail.com);


Server Projects:

All server files work together. All jar files must be executed for the server to run.
