# Spotlight-Social-Network
SpotLight was supposed to be a social network, I started developing it when I was 16. I developed it about 3 Years, now I have stopped working and share the source code. I uploaded the server and app code, you can use it. A camera with face recognition and filters is also installed in the app. You can send pictures and videos and then save them.
